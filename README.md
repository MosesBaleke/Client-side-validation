# Client-side-validation
This is a two-way slide project with both a login and a sign-up form. 
Each form has its own type of validation. The Sign-up form was developed using 
built in HTML5 and CSS features to ensure all required form controls are filled out. 
The login form comprised of all HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The goal was to take control over 
the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation.
